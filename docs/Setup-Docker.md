### Docker setup

- Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your local machine.

```bash
# NPM example:
npm install -g @go-task/cli
```

- Open `Git Bash for Windows` or other terminal and run the following commands:
- Run `task` command in your terminal for start the application.
- Run `task post-create` command only once after installation in your terminal.
